### Test case vs. test scenario 

When writing a **test case**, you typically think about every detail of "how" something should behave. For example, if you’re developing a login system, a test case might be that an error is displayed if you enter an incorrect email address. Then you may have tests for:

- Not entering any email address
    
- Adding a space at the end of an email address
    
- Use all caps for the email address
    
- Capitalizing the first letter of the email address
    

**Test scenarios, also called test conditions or test possibilities,** represent typical tasks users might want to accomplish with the software. A simple test scenario may require multiple test cases to cover the different outcomes. In our login system, some scenarios could be "I can successfully log in" or "I can't log in without entering my email address correctly."
